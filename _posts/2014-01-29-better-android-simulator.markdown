Have you ever experienced that sudden sense of dread when you realise that line of code you entered isn't the fix for that pesky bug. Normally this wouldn't be too bad. However this bug is in an Android app, running in the Google emulator. If you're lucky you've found the [snapshot feature](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5154636). If you haven't, well, you must really be getting frustrated.

### Solution

I've found the best solution so far is to use [Genymotion](http://www.genymotion.com/). It's super fast, reliable and just awesome.
