I found the following quote very true:
> The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it's to post the wrong answer.

Nothing insights a nerd's rage like the crime of incorrectly writing something to the net. This also triggers in us all an opportunity to show off how much we know that we would otherwise never get a chance to. Heck, we might even get some points / kudos / likes for it too. Nothing is more gratifying than that right? Speaking of which, care to share?
