Currently [Ghost](www.ghost.io) doesn't come with any out of the box search feature.

### Solution
There is a great search api called [tapir](http://tapirgo.com/) which takes an RSS feed and indexes it. I found a library called Tapirus by metacotta. Unfortunatley the [site](www.metacotta.com/introducing-tapirus) no longer seems to be up. I put the library they wrote up on Github and made a few enchancements.

You can find it at [here](https://github.com/shaydesdsgn/jquery.sd.tapirgo).
