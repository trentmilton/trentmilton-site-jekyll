Are you locked out of your Twitter account and can't get the mobile authentication working. The SMS isn't coming through? Look no further.

### Solution

NOTE: In order for this to work you must have a Twitter PIN, if you don't there really isn't any way to get one so you'll probably have to contact support.

1.	First you need to find your short / long code (which is actually a mobile number:<br> http://support.twitter.com/articles/14226-finding-your-twitter-short-or-long-code.
2.	Then you need to send your Twitter PIN along with **GO** (Notice it's uppercase) to the short / long code (which again is a mobile number). e.g. '**1234 GO**' would be the text of your message
3.	Go back to Twitter and try and send the SMS verification again.
