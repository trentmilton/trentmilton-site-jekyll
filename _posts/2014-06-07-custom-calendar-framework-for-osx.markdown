The [NSDatePicker](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/reference/applicationkit/classes/nsdatepicker_class/reference/reference.html) is barely customisable for the month view. Most offerings online aren't for OSX or they aren't that easy to customise.

### Solution
I rolled my own and chucked it on  [GitHub](https://github.com/shaydesdsgn/SDFCalendarOSX).
