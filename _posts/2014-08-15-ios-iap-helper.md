I have released a helper class [here](https://github.com/shaydesdsgn/SDFIAPHelper) I've used in the past.

The class will help simplify using the App Stores in app purchase mechanism which can be a little difficult to get your head around the first time.

This is heavily based on the tutorial located [here](http://www.raywenderlich.com/21081/introduction-to-in-app-purchases-in-ios-6-tutorial.
