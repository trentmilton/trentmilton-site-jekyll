I had an issue the other day trying to log in to my youtube account on my apple tv. I couldn't work out what was going on for a while. My password was correct, account was right. No idea...

### Solution
You can **only login** with you **google account** now. However it can't contain the **@gmail.com**. So make sure you enter just the username part of your email. i.e. firstname.lastname@gmail.com, you would just enter the **firstname.lastname* as your YouTube account name.
